# Jeopardy Online

## About



## Playing

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
yarn install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Implementation

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push to Heroku. As is, the NPM scripts should take care of the rest.
